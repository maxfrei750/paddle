== ðŸš§ UNDER DEVELOPMENT ðŸš§

Everything in this repository (except https://github.com/maxfrei750/paddle/releases[releases]) may change at any given point in time.

'''

This repository is a toolbox for the easy, deep learning-based primary particle size analysis of agglomerated, aggregated, partially sintered or simply occluded particles. It is the successor of the https://github.com/maxfrei750/DeepParticleNet[DeepParticleNet] toolbox, which accompanies the following publication:

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2019.10.020[Image-Based Size Determination of Agglomerated
and Partially Sintered Particles via Convolutional Neural Networks]

image::assets/example_psd.png[Example PSD Measurement, 400, 265]

The utilized convolutional neural network is based on the Mask R-CNN architecture, developed by https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870[He et al.]. It was implemented using https://pytorch.org/[PyTorch], https://github.com/pytorch/vision[torchvision] and https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning[PyTorchLightning].

== Installation
. Install https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html[conda] for your operating system.
. Open a command line.
. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/maxfrei750/paddle.git`
. Change into the folder of the repository: `cd paddle`
. Create a new conda environment: `conda env create --file environment.yaml`

== Getting started
. Open a command line.
. Activate the conda environment: `activate paddle`
. Start JupyterLab: `jupyter lab` and click one of the links to access the JupyterLab server.
